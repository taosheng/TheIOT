The Plan and also the TODOs

(1) nodejs to host a web socket in 8080, allow retrieve data from sqlite
(2) websocket web page to real time access nodejs websocket server
    (2.1) initial page shows past 24 hours data
    (2.2) update page every N seconds
(3) a graphic show trend of Air quality, HCHO, dust
(4) a python cron job to gather sensor data every N seconds and put in sqlite

Why so complicated? Just for fun...
